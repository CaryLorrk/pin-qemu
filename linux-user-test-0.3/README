This directory contains the necessary libraries and executables to
test the QEMU User Linux emulation.

Edit the 'qemu-linux-user.sh' script to set the path to the QEMU
version you want to test. Then type:

make test

to test the working targets.

The test consists in launching a dynamically linked "ls -l" command.

You can test a single target by specifying it as parameter to
'qemu-linux-user.sh'.

Source of the executables and libraries:

- Debian cdrom installers (file initrd.gz) (hppa, x86_64, m68k, mips,
  mipsel, arm, alpha, ppc, sparc)

- Gentoo stage 1 (ppc64)

- Statically linked programs for sparc64  (Thanx to Blue Swirl)
